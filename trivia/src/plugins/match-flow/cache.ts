/**
 * @file match-flow plugin — the host-clock slice cache (the shared module-closure state).
 *
 * The authoritative host clock (`clock.ts`) snapshots the live `match`/`question`/`steal`/`players`
 * slices into this module's closure on every tick; the intent handlers (`init.ts` — `answer-lock` and
 * `play-again`) read them back between ticks. This module owns that single piece of cross-concern
 * mutable state behind an explicit get/set API, so the writer (clock) and the readers (intents) never
 * reach into each other's module.
 *
 * The cache is a module-scoped singleton: the plugin is a single app instance, so a module `let` is
 * safe, and `stopClock` (called from `onStop`, which receives only `TeardownContext` — spec/08-CONTEXT
 * §2) can clear it.
 * @see ./clock.ts — the writer (setSliceCache / clearSliceCache)
 * @see ./init.ts — the readers (the answer-lock / play-again intent handlers)
